# metrological-station-arduino
This project is based on the C++ programming language for building a mini metrological station with basic components interacting with an Arduino platform. 

It is worth noting that the project competed in the "Science Circuit of Public Schools of the Federal District" in Brazil, which won 3rd place. 
In order to make the necessary meteorological measurements for the written project, it stood out for the accuracy of the data and the low cost required for construction.

Components used:
- Arduino UNO;
- DHT22 Module;
- HC05 Bluetooth Module;
- LCD 16x2;
- Basic led's.

App used:
"DHT11  with Bluetooth" available on the Play Store (Android);
